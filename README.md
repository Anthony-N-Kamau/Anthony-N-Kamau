## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anthony Kamau, an aspiring data scientist. I am interested in all things Python, R, Machine learning, Deep Learning and Robotics!

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm mainly working on machine learning algorithms and also performning data manipulation, visualization and analysis using datasets from data science communities such as [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) etc. 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and mastering R.
  -  Join me in this interesting journey of growth and knowledge!
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new and interesting projects and datasets.

- âš¡ Fun fact: AI has the potential to boost economic growth. The 2018 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) projects that AI will contribute approximately $15.7 trillion to the global GDP from 2018 to 2030, representing a 14% increment in economic output and an annual productivity increase of 55%. Developing countries can skip stages of development by adopting the latest technology even if they haven't gone through the same industrialization process as developed countries (Technological leapfrogging). However, greater care should be taken to avoid falling into a technology trap and undermining of equity and fairness. Income inequality may increase and governments may become bigger than is needed creating a leviathan.
