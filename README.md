- âš¡ Fun fact: Artificial intelligence has the potential to become a powerful engine of global economic growth. A PwC report from 2018 estimated that by 2030, AI could contribute as much as $15.7 trillion to the world economy - equivalent to a 14% increase in output and a 55% jump in annual productivity. For developing countries, this technology presents a unique opportunity to bypass traditional stages of industrialization and move straight into advanced digital systems. At the same time, the pace of progress brings serious challenges. Without strong governance, AI could deepen inequality, undermine fairness, and concentrate power in the hands of already dominant state actors.
