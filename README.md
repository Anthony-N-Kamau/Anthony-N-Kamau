- âš¡ Fun fact: Artificial intelligence holds significant promise for driving global economic growth. According to a 2018 PwC report, AI could add around $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030 - an estimated 14% boost in output and a 55% rise in annual productivity. For developing nations, AI offers a chance to leapfrog traditional industrial stages by adopting cutting edge technologies. However, this rapid advancement comes with risks: without careful governance, AI could exacerbate income inequality, compromise fairness and empower overly dominant state actors.
