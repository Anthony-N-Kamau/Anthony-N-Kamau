- âš¡ Fun fact: AI has the potential to boost economic growth. Some predictions suggest that AI could increase GDP growth by 1.1% to 1.6% over the next decade, with a roughly 0.05% annual gain in productivity (technology * efficiency). Developing countries can skip stages of development by adopting the latest technology even if they haven't gone through the same industrialization process as developed countries (Technological leapfrogging). However, greater care should be taken to avoid falling into a technology trap and undermining of equity and fairness. Income inequality may increase and governments may become bigger than is needed creating a leviathan.
